Put Out Fire Demo:

Goal: NxN grid where user spawns and fire spawns, as they move the fire spreads, moving onto the fire puts out the fire

Parameters: Fire spread probability, view distance

Tasks:
    1. Make grid (NXN size)
    2. Add movable character
    3. Illlustrate view distance
    4. Add fire
    5. Give fire a spread probability each time the user moves
    6. allow the user to put out the fire
