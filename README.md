## FireResearchMR
Contains the entire Unity project for the fire demo. Currently, there are 3 different scenes: **2DFireExtinguish**, **ARFireTestQuest**, and **RLFireExtinguish** which are described in more detail below.

#### 2DFireExtinguish
A basic demo of the grid being created on the plane with a player that can be moved around and tracked. Fire spreads each time the player moves into a new square with a set probability.

#### ARFireTestQuest
XR demo in which the grid is placed upon the floor found by the MRUK room scan.

#### RLFireExtinguish
Q-Learning implementation in which the "player" is now a Q-Learning agent which learns to find fire.

## Python
Contains python demo of fire extinguish AI using basic object-oriented structure for environments and algorithms.

## Practice
Contains a couple practice demos I made to learn about RL from different YouTube videos/courses.

## Media
Media relevant to the project.
